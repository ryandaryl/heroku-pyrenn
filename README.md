# Recurrent neural network examples with pyrenn
This web application is based an introduction to background worker processes in Heroku, which can be found at the [Heroku Devcenter](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-rq).

The background worker runs an example script from the [pyrenn](https://pyrenn.readthedocs.io/en/latest) recurrent neural network [Github repo](https://github.com/yabata/pyrenn). There's no front-end, so the user has to click a link to check if the neural network has been trained and tested.

See it working [here](https://rnn-rdm.herokuapp.com).

I've added app.json and this readme so you can:
